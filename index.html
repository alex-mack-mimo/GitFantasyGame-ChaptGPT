    <h1>LightHouse 4</h1>
    <p>
Once upon a time, there was a man named Tom who lived in a small coastal town. He had heard a rumor that there was a treasure hidden in the lighthouse at the edge of town. Excited by the prospect of finding riches, he set out to explore the lighthouse.

Tom searched every inch of the lighthouse but found no sign of any treasure. Disappointed, he climbed to the top to take in the view of the sea. As he gazed out across the water, he noticed a ship in the distance, struggling to navigate through the rough waters and enter the harbor.

Tom realized that the lighthouse could be used to guide the ship to safety. He quickly lit the lamp in the lighthouse and swung the beam out to sea. The bright light caught the attention of the crew on the ship, and they were able to use it as a guide to safely navigate through the rough waters and into the harbor.

The crew of the ship was grateful for Tom's help, and they thanked him for his bravery. Tom felt proud and fulfilled, knowing that he had been able to use the lighthouse to help those in need.

Although he had not found the treasure he had been seeking, Tom had discovered something much more valuable - the satisfaction of helping others and making a difference in the world. From that day on, he continued to tend the lighthouse, using its light to guide ships safely to shore.

The end.
