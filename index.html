    <h1>Royal Castle 4</h1>

    <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a young hero named Alexander. He was known throughout the land for his bravery and cunning, and he had always dreamed of finding the greatest treasure in the world.

One day, Alexander heard of an evil wizard who had taken over a castle in the mountains and was terrorizing the nearby villages. The wizard was said to have a vast hoard of treasure, and Alexander decided that this was his chance to make his fortune.

He set out on his journey, facing countless challenges along the way. But nothing could prepare him for the horrors that awaited him at the castle. The wizard had an army of demons at his command, and the castle was guarded by traps and puzzles that would test even the bravest of heroes.

But Alexander was determined to succeed. He fought his way through the castle, facing danger at every turn. Finally, he reached the wizard's throne room, where he engaged the evil magician in a fierce battle.

Alexander fought with all his might, using his sword and his wits to try to defeat the wizard. But in the end, he was no match for the wizard's powerful magic. The wizard defeated Alexander and trapped him in the castle, where he was left to rot.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Alexander's hopes of finding the treasure faded, and he began to lose hope. But he never gave up. He continued to search the castle, looking for a way out and hoping to find some trace of the wizard's hoard.

In the end, Alexander discovered a secret passage that led him out of the castle and back to freedom. But he had found no treasure, and he realized that his quest for wealth had been in vain.

However, Alexander was not discouraged. He had learned that the greatest treasure of all was the courage and determination he had shown in his journey. And he knew that he would carry those qualities with him for the rest of his life. He returned home a hero, and his story was told for generations to come.
