    <h1>LightHouse 3</h1>
    <p>
Once upon a time, there was a man named James who lived in a small coastal town. He had heard a rumor that there was a treasure hidden in the lighthouse at the edge of town. Intrigued by the possibility of finding riches, he decided to explore the lighthouse.

James searched high and low, but he found no sign of any treasure. Disappointed, he climbed to the top of the lighthouse to take in the view of the sea. As he gazed out across the water, he noticed an old man sitting on a bench nearby.

The old man was the lighthouse guard, and James struck up a conversation with him. The guard was happy to chat and told James about his many years of working at the lighthouse. During their conversation, James learned about the history of the lighthouse and the town, as well as the history of the country as a whole.

James was fascinated by the stories the guard told, and he realized that he had been so focused on finding treasure that he had overlooked the richness of the history and culture that surrounded him. He thanked the guard for the conversation and promised to come back and visit him again.

From that day on, James became passionate about learning about the history of his country. He visited the lighthouse often, chatting with the guard and soaking up the stories and knowledge he had to share. James realized that the treasure he had been seeking was not hidden in the lighthouse, but it was hidden in the stories and history of the people who lived there.

The end.
