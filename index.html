    <h1>LightHouse 1</h1>
    <p>
Once upon a time, there was a man named David who lived in a small coastal town. He had heard a rumor that there was treasure hidden in the lighthouse at the edge of town, and he was determined to find it.

David climbed to the top of the lighthouse and searched every corner, but he found no sign of any treasure. Disappointed, he decided to take in the view of the sea and enjoy the scenery. As he stood at the railing, he noticed that the wind was starting to pick up.

Suddenly, a strong gust of wind hit the lighthouse, causing it to sway and shake. David quickly realized that the wind was becoming more intense and that the lighthouse was in danger of collapsing. He tried to make his way down, but the wind was too strong, and he was trapped at the top.

David braced himself for the worst, but just then, a group of fishermen in a boat noticed the lighthouse was in trouble and set out to rescue him. They managed to reach the lighthouse and help David down to safety, just as the lighthouse collapsed into the sea.

Although David had not found the treasure he was searching for, he was grateful to be alive and thankful for the bravery of the fishermen who rescued him. He realized that there were more important things in life than wealth, such as the kindness and bravery of others.

The end.
