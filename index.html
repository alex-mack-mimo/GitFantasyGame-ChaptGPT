    <h1>LightHouse 5</h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived in a small coastal town. He had heard a rumor that there was a treasure hidden at the top of the lighthouse in the town. The lighthouse was said to have been built by a wealthy shipowner many years ago, and the treasure was said to be a reward for anyone who could reach the top.

Determined to find the treasure, Jack set out on a journey to climb the lighthouse. He encountered many challenges along the way, including strong winds, slippery steps, and treacherous ledges. But he was determined to reach the top, and he pushed on.

Finally, after many hours of climbing, Jack reached the top of the lighthouse. He looked around, but there was no sign of any treasure. Disappointed, he sat down on a bench to catch his breath and take in the view.

As he sat there, he realized that the true reward of his journey was not the treasure he had been seeking, but the journey itself. The climb had tested his courage, strength, and determination, and he had emerged a better person because of it. He took in the stunning view of the sea and the town below and felt a sense of peace and satisfaction that he had never felt before.

From that day on, Jack continued to climb the lighthouse every year, not in search of treasure, but in search of the sense of accomplishment and peace that came with the journey. The lighthouse and the climb to the top had become his treasure, and he was grateful for the lessons he had learned along the way.

The end.
