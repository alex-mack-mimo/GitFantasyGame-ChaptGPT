    <h1>LightHouse 2</h1>
    <p>
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who lived near a lighthouse on the coast. She had heard a rumor that there was treasure hidden in the lighthouse and decided to go and explore it.

Lily climbed to the top of the lighthouse, searching every nook and cranny, but she found no treasure. Disappointed, she decided to take a walk along the coast to clear her mind. As she walked, she noticed a mother pelican flying back and forth, making a lot of noise.

Lily followed the pelican and discovered that it was trying to protect its nest and eggs from a group of seagulls who were trying to steal them. Lily realized that she needed to help the pelican, so she quickly climbed up to the nest and chased away the seagulls.

The mother pelican was grateful for Lily's help and thanked her with a soft chirp. Lily felt happy knowing that she had helped protect the pelican's eggs and nest. She spent the rest of the day watching over the nest, making sure the seagulls didn't come back.

Although Lily had not found the treasure she was looking for, she had found something much more valuable - the satisfaction of helping a creature in need and making a difference in its life. She returned to the lighthouse every day to check on the pelican and its eggs, watching as they hatched and the baby pelicans grew.

The end.
